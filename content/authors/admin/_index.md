I am currently an intern at Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI). I will start my PhD in September in Peking University under the supervision of Dr. Yixin-Zhu. I received my M.Sc. from Department of Computing at Imperial College London.

My research interests lie in computer vision, machine learning and optimization. I currently focus on the understanding of human-object interaction in real 3D scenes
